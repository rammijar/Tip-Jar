# Tip-Jar
Support students with small Pi tips!  This app allows Pi Network users to send a small tip (like 0.1 Pi) to support students and young creators. Just log in with your Pi account, and tap the “Send Tip” button.  A little Pi goes a long way in helping someone grow! Built using the Pi SDK by a student learning to code.
